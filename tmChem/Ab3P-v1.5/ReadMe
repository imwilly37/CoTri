Welcome to Abbreviation Plus Pseudo-Precision (Ab3P)

This abbreviation identification package is provided as a C++ library.
The sample program can be used to identify abbreviations in plain
text.

The command 'make' builds the library, builds the program, and creates
the data files.  The command 'make test' runs the abbreviation
identification program on our gold standard and compares your
results to our results.  They should be identical.

To identify SF-LF pairs from free text use the command
  ./identify_abbr text_file_name
It processes the input one line at a time and prints out:

input line
  sf|lf|P-precision

To run this program in a directory other than where it was originally
built, include a file called 'path_Ab3P' in the directory that gives
the path to the WordData directory. Include the final slash (/).

The program identify_abbr.C also provides an example of using the Ab3P
library in a program.  Documentation on the routines can be found in
Library/Ab3P.h 

Information Ab3P needs to work appears in the WordData directory. This
includes information about words and abbreviation strategies and their
estimated precision in 'Ab3P_prec.dat'. Stop words are in the file
'stop'.  Long forms for 1-character short forms are in the file
'Lf1chSf'.  Defined words, for subword matching, are in
'SingTermFreq.dat'.

Before this information can be used by the program, it needs to be in
a form the program can efficiently access.  The command 'make data'
creates these files.

We provide 1250 random MEDLINE records annotated manually
(MED1250_labeled) and the original unlabeled version
(MED1250_unlabeled). The format of the labeled data is:

PubMed ID
Title
Abstract
  sf|lf (skip two space in the beginning)

Double slashes indicate comments. Certain comments have a particular
meaning as follows:

//*  sf|lf
  skip two spaces after //*) for synonyms.   Synonyms are
  identified but not included in the gold standard.

//!syn
  If there is no matching character for technical terms, including
  element symbols, for example MeHg|methyl mercury.

//!out
  If the long form does not appear earlier in the same sentence.

//!ord
  If the matching characters are not in the same order.  For example,
  Y73SV|Sarcoma Virus Y73

//!num
  If a number matches a word.  For example, 2D|two dimension

//!nch
  If we find a long form, but some characters do not match.  For
  example, Bet|Bel-1 plus Bel-2

//!cnj
  Conjunction complicates long form determination.  For example, alpha
  beta (ABG) and coal delta (DDG) gamma.

//
  any other comments (not starting with '!')

Change Log:

v1.5   Easier to run identify_abbr from a directory other than where built.

v1.1   API clarified

v1      Original public release
