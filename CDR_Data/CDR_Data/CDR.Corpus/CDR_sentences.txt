9636837_1|s|BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects.

9636837_2|s|However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage.

9636837_9|s|CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

9431903_4|s|RESULTS: Prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi.
