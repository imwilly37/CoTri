10721819
10721819	10721819-00	Effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats.
10721819	10721819-01	It has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart.
10721819	10721819-02	This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats.
10721819	10721819-03	Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate.
10721819	10721819-04	In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia.
10721819	10721819-05	Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg).
10721819	10721819-06	Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment.
10721819	10721819-07	In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold).
10721819	10721819-08	These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart.
10721819	10721819-09	They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.

11147747	11147747-00	Serotonergic antidepressants and urinary incontinence.
11147747	11147747-01	Many new serotonergic antidepressants have been introduced over the past decade.
11147747	11147747-02	Although urinary incontinence is listed as one side effect of these drugs in their package inserts there is only one report in the literature.
11147747	11147747-03	This concerns 2 male patients who experienced incontinence while taking venlafaxine.
11147747	11147747-04	In the present paper the authors describe 2 female patients who developed incontinence secondary to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors paroxetine and sertraline, as well as a third who developed this side effect on venlafaxine.
11147747	11147747-05	In 2 of the 3 cases the patients were also taking lithium carbonate and beta-blockers, both of which could have contributed to the incontinence.
11147747	11147747-06	Animal studies suggest that incontinence secondary to serotonergic antidepressants could be mediated by the 5HT4 receptors found on the bladder.
11147747	11147747-07	Further research is needed to delineate the frequency of this troubling side effect and how best to treat it.

11587867	11587867-02	The girl died seven days, the man four weeks after intrathecal injection of vincristine.
11587867	11587867-03	Clinically, the onset was characterized by the signs of opistothonus, sensory and motor dysfunction and ascending paralysis.
11587867	11587867-04	Histological and immunohistochemical investigations (HE-LFB, CD-68, Neurofilament) revealed degeneration of myelin and axons as well as pseudocystic transformation in areas exposed to vincristine, accompanied by secondary changes with numerous prominent macrophages.

11897407	11897407-01	Infarct-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.
11897407	11897407-02	The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol.
11897407	11897407-03	A new infarct-avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ. 99mTc-glucarate was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction.
11897407	11897407-04	Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration.
11897407	11897407-05	The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys.
11897407	11897407-06	Thirty minutes after 99mTc-glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats.
11897407	11897407-07	ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4.
11897407	11897407-08	The high image quality suggests that high contrast images can be obtained in humans and the 96 h stability makes it an ideal agent to detect, in patients, early cardiac infarction.

12584269	12584269-01	BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation.
12584269	12584269-02	These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open.
12584269	12584269-03	In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described.
12584269	12584269-04	The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations.
12584269	12584269-05	METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats.
12584269	12584269-06	In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA).
12584269	12584269-07	The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red.
12584269	12584269-08	RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR.
12584269	12584269-09	A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances.
12584269	12584269-10	The morphological changes presented a similar pattern.
12584269	12584269-11	The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02).
12584269	12584269-12	The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05).
12584269	12584269-13	CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated.

12905102	12905102-01	BACKGROUND: Incidence and risk factors for delirium during clozapine treatment require further clarification.
12905102	12905102-02	METHODS: We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine (1995-96), reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium, and tested associations with potential risk factors.
12905102	12905102-03	RESULTS: Subjects (n = 139) were 72 women and 67 men, aged 40.8 +/- 12.1 years, hospitalized for 24.9 +/- 23.3 days, and given clozapine, gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 +/- 203 mg (3.45 +/- 2.45 mg/kg) for 18.9 +/- 16.4 days.
12905102	12905102-04	Delirium was diagnosed in 14 (10.1 % incidence, or 1.48 cases/person-years of exposure); 71.4 % of cases were moderate or severe.
12905102	12905102-05	Associated factors were co-treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents, poor clinical outcome, older age, and longer hospitalization (by 17.5 days, increasing cost); sex, diagnosis or medical co-morbidity, and daily clozapine dose, which fell with age, were unrelated.
12905102	12905102-06	CONCLUSIONS: Delirium was found in 10 % of clozapine-treated inpatients, particularly in older patients exposed to other central anticholinergics.
12905102	12905102-07	Delirium was inconsistently recognized clinically in milder cases and was associated with increased length-of-stay and higher costs, and inferior clinical outcome.

16298782	16298782-01	The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin, but further studies are needed to confirm this.Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost.
16298782	16298782-02	Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO, we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss.
16298782	16298782-03	In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague-Dawley rats, 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear.

16330766	16330766-04	The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin, a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients, on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states.
16330766	16330766-05	Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in normal volunteers, we studied the gabapentin-induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin-induced secondary hyperalgesia.
16330766	16330766-06	The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os, in a single administration.
16330766	16330766-07	We found that (i) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex, independently of the presence of central sensitization; (ii) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem, only during central sensitization; (iii) gabapentin suppressed stimulus-induced deactivations, only during central sensitization; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation.
16330766	16330766-08	The observed drug-induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline fMRI signal.
16330766	16330766-09	These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation, thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present.

17175308	17175308-00	Proteinuria after conversion to sirolimus in renal transplant recipients.
17175308	17175308-01	Sirolimus (SRL) is a new, potent immunosuppressive agent.
17175308	17175308-02	More recently, proteinuria has been reported as a consequence of sirolimus therapy, although the mechanism has remained unclear.
17175308	17175308-03	We retrospectively examined the records of 25 renal transplant patients, who developed or displayed increased proteinuria after SRL conversion.
17175308	17175308-04	The patient cohort (14 men, 11 women) was treated with SRL as conversion therapy, due to chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) (n = 15) neoplasia (n = 8); Kaposi's sarcoma, Four skin cancers, One intestinal tumors, One renal cell carsinom) or BK virus nephropathy (n = 2).
17175308	17175308-05	SRL was started at a mean of 78 +/- 42 (15 to 163) months after transplantation.
17175308	17175308-06	Mean follow-up on SRL therapy was 20 +/- 12 (6 to 43) months.
17175308	17175308-07	Proteinuria increased from 0.445 (0 to 1.5) g/d before conversion to 3.2 g/dL (0.2 to 12) after conversion (P = 0.001).
17175308	17175308-08	Before conversion 8 (32%) patients had no proteinuria, whereas afterwards all patients had proteinuria.
17175308	17175308-09	In 28% of patients proteinuria remained unchanged, whereas it increased in 68% of patients.
17175308	17175308-10	In 40% it increased by more than 100%.
17175308	17175308-11	Twenty-eight percent of patients showed increased proteinuria to the nephrotic range.
17175308	17175308-12	Biopsies performed in five patients revealed new pathological changes: One membranoproliferative glomerulopathy and interstitial nephritis.
17175308	17175308-13	These patients showed persistently good graft function.
17175308	17175308-14	Serum creatinine values did not change significantly: 1.98 +/- 0.8 mg/dL before SRL therapy and 2.53 +/- 1.9 mg/dL at last follow-up (P = .14).
17175308	17175308-15	Five grafts were lost and the patients returned to dialysis.
17175308	17175308-16	Five patients displayed CAN and Kaposi's sarcoma.
17175308	17175308-17	Mean urinary protein of patients who returned to dialysis was 1.26 (0.5 to 3.5) g/d before and 4.7 (3 to 12) g/d after conversion (P = .01).
17175308	17175308-18	Mean serum creatinine level before conversion was 2.21 mg/dL and thereafter, 4.93 mg/dL (P = .02).
17175308	17175308-19	Heavy proteinuria was common after the use of SRL as rescue therapy for renal transplantation.
17175308	17175308-20	Therefore, conversion should be considered for patients who have not developed advanced CAN and proteinuria.
17175308	17175308-21	The possibility of de novo glomerular pathology under SRL treatment requires further investigation by renal biopsy.

1720453	1720453-00	Long-term follow-up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors: an International Society of Pediatric Oncology report.
1720453	1720453-01	The renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor Study 84 [SIOP MMT 84]) were studied 1 year after the completion of treatment.
1720453	1720453-02	Total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g/m2 of ifosfamide (six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin [IVA]).
1720453	1720453-03	None of them had received cisplatin chemotherapy.
1720453	1720453-04	Ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years; 58 patients were males and 42 females.
1720453	1720453-05	The most common primary tumor site was the head and neck.
1720453	1720453-06	Renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes, glucosuria, proteinuria, aminoaciduria, urinary pH, osmolarity, creatinine clearance, phosphate tubular reabsorption, beta 2 microglobulinuria, and lysozymuria.
1720453	1720453-07	Fifty-eight patients (78%) had normal renal tests, whereas 16 patients (22%) had renal abnormalities.
1720453	1720453-08	Two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group: the first included four patients (5% of the total population) who developed major toxicity resulting in Fanconi's syndrome (TDFS); and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 microglobulinuria and low phosphate reabsorption.

17242861	17242861-03	QTLs for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, have not been reported, and CSS have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility genes.
17242861	17242861-04	We report QTLs identified using a B6 (host) x A/J (donor) CSS panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures.
17242861	17242861-05	Three hundred fifty-five adult male CSS mice, 58 B6, and 39 A/J were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine-induced seizures.
17242861	17242861-06	Highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mice.
17242861	17242861-07	B6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to A/J mice.
17242861	17242861-08	The CSS for Chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages, diverging dramatically from the B6 phenotype.
17242861	17242861-09	Latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for CSS10 and CSS18 mice.
17242861	17242861-10	CSS mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse Chromosomes 10 and 18.
17242861	17242861-11	This approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy.

17615423	17615423-06	Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL.
17615423	17615423-07	The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered.
17615423	17615423-08	DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism.
17615423	17615423-09	Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4.
17615423	17615423-10	Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors.
17615423	17615423-11	CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions.
17615423	17615423-12	In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.

18439803	18439803-00	Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine-induced seizure in rats.
18439803	18439803-01	The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters (glutamate, aspartate, glycine and GABA) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea (VPU) in comparison to its parent compound, valproic acid (VPA).
18439803	18439803-02	VPU was more potent than VPA, exhibiting the median effective dose (ED(50)) of 49 mg/kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine-induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg/kg.
18439803	18439803-03	In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA.
18439803	18439803-04	Pretreatment with either VPU (50 and 100 mg/kg) or VPA (300 and 600 mg/kg) completely abolished pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate.
18439803	18439803-05	In addition, a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level.
18439803	18439803-06	Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine-induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate.
18439803	18439803-07	Therefore, like VPA, the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine-induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account, at least partly, for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine-induced seizure in experimental animals.
18439803	18439803-08	Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated.

18619688	18619688-01	BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear.
18619688	18619688-02	The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure.
18619688	18619688-03	METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin.
18619688	18619688-04	Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group.
18619688	18619688-05	We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo.
18619688	18619688-06	We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes.
18619688	18619688-07	In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model.
18619688	18619688-08	RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury.

18619688	18619688-09	Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles.
18619688	18619688-10	CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin.
18619688	18619688-11	Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway.

18809400	18809400-00	Alpha-lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy.
18809400	18809400-01	The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection.
18809400	18809400-02	We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs.
18809400	18809400-03	This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid.
18809400	18809400-04	Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons.
18809400	18809400-05	Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties.

19657887	19657887-01	Hydrogen cyanamide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit trees.
19657887	19657887-02	Contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use.
19657887	19657887-03	The purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a disulfiram-like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyanamide.
19657887	19657887-04	The first case involved a 59-year-old man who used Dormex, which contains hydrogen cyanamide, without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a meal.
19657887	19657887-05	In less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol, he developed malaise with flushing of the face, tachycardia, and dyspnea.
19657887	19657887-06	Manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospital.
19657887	19657887-07	The second case occurred in a 55-year-old farmer following cutaneous contact with Dormex.
19657887	19657887-08	Five hours after exposure, he developed disulfiram-like syndrome with flushing, tachycardia, and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of wine.
19657887	19657887-09	The patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospital.
19657887	19657887-10	These cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of Dormex and of preventing cutaneous contact during use.

21029050	21029050-07	RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent.
21029050	21029050-08	The duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature.
21029050	21029050-09	Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients.
21029050	21029050-10	Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients.
21029050	21029050-11	CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea.
21029050	21029050-12	We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT.

2224762	2224762-01	A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors.
2224762	2224762-02	Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction.
2224762	2224762-03	A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable.
2224762	2224762-04	Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2.
2224762	2224762-05	The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia.
2224762	2224762-06	Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22).
2224762	2224762-07	Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis.
2224762	2224762-08	Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
2224762	2224762-09	Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours.
2224762	2224762-10	The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2.
2224762	2224762-11	Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites.
2224762	2224762-12	Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%.
2224762	2224762-13	Activity was noted in mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma.
2224762	2224762-14	The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks.

2348231	2348231-04	Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.).
2348231	2348231-05	Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups.
2348231	2348231-06	Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002).
2348231	2348231-07	Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01).
2348231	2348231-08	We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.

2887062	2887062-00	Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen-induced rat prolactinomas after bromocriptine treatment.
2887062	2887062-01	To clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactinoma cells in vivo, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and morphometrical analyses were applied to estrogen-induced rat prolactinoma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine (3 mg/kg of body weight).
2887062	2887062-02	One h after treatment, serum prolactin levels decreased markedly.
2887062	2887062-03	Electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules, slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum, and partially dilated Golgi cisternae in the prolactinoma cells.
2887062	2887062-04	Morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased, while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decreased.
2887062	2887062-05	These findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtubules.
2887062	2887062-06	At 6 h after injection, serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in controls.
2887062	2887062-07	The prolactinoma cells at this time were well granulated, with vesiculated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated Golgi cisternae.
2887062	2887062-08	Electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules, Golgi cisternae, and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactinoma cells.
2887062	2887062-09	However, only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cells.
2887062	2887062-10	An increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis, suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion.

3173180	3173180-03	While the involvement of metronidazole in the aetiology of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome is not established firmly, the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome suggest a possible link between metronidazole treatment and some cases of the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome.

3615541	3615541-01	Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain, and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects.
3615541	3615541-02	Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.
3615541	3615541-03	In previous experiments we found that decreases in food intake were induced by local administration of calcitonin into several hypothalamic sites and into the nucleus accumbens.

3615541	3615541-04	In the present experiment calcitonin decreased locomotor activity when locally injected into the same sites where it decreases food intake.
3615541	3615541-05	The areas where calcitonin is most effective in decreasing locomotor activity are located in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens, suggesting that these areas are the major sites of action of calcitonin in inhibiting amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.

3827439	3827439-02	The abruptness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dysfunction.
3827439	3827439-03	We propose that amphotericin, in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume, may activate tubuloglomerular feedback, thereby contributing to acute renal failure.

7352670
7352670	7352670-00	Rebound hypertensive after sodium nitroprusside prevented by saralasin in rats.
7352670	7352670-01	The role of the renin--angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced hypotension was evaluated.
7352670	7352670-02	Control rats received halothane anesthesia (1 MAC) for one hour, followed by SNP infusion, 40 microgram/kg/min, for 30 min, followed by a 30-min recovery period.
7352670	7352670-03	A second group of rats was treated identically and, in addition, received an infusion of saralasin (a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin II) throughout the experimental period.
7352670	7352670-04	In each group, SNP infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 torr and 83 torr, respectively, to 48 torr.
7352670	7352670-05	During the SNP infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 torr, whereas the saralasin-treated animals showed no change.
7352670	7352670-06	Following discontinuation of SNP, blood pressure in the control animals rebounded to 94 torr, as compared with 78 torr in the saralasin-treated rats.
7352670	7352670-07	This study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia, the partial recovery of blood pressure during SNP infusion and the post-SNP rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by saralasin.
7352670	7352670-08	This demonstrates the participation of the renin--angiotensin system in antagonizing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and SNP.

7420681	7420681-01	Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually.
7420681	7420681-02	Gentamicin sulfate and tobramycin sulfate continue to demonstrate ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity in both animal and clinical studies.
7420681	7420681-03	In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function.
7420681	7420681-04	In these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified.
7420681	7420681-05	Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure.
7420681	7420681-06	Thus, gentamicin was associated with renal failure more than three times as often as was tobramycin.

8643971	8643971-01	Improved outcomes among patients with head and neck carcinomas require investigations of new drugs for induction therapy.
8643971	8643971-02	Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) reported a 37% response rate in patients with head and neck cancer, and the paclitaxel/cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients.
8643971	8643971-03	We initiated a phase I/II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed-dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma.
8643971	8643971-04	To date, 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial.
8643971	8643971-05	Primary tumor sites were oropharynx, 10 patients; hypopharynx, four; larynx, two; oral cavity, three; unknown primary, two; and nasal cavity and parotid gland, one each.
8643971	8643971-06	Of 20 patients evaluable for toxicity, four had stage III and 16 had stage IV disease.
8643971	8643971-07	Treatment, given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles, consisted of paclitaxel by 3-hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin (75 mg/m2).
8643971	8643971-08	The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses, and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits.
8643971	8643971-09	At the time of this writing, dose level 4 (260, 270, and 280 mg/m2) is being evaluated; three patients from this level are evaluable.
8643971	8643971-10	With paclitaxel doses of 200 mg/m2 and higher, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d is given (days 4 through 12).
8643971	8643971-11	Of 18 patients evaluable for response, seven (39%) achieved a complete response and six (33%) achieved a partial response.
8643971	8643971-12	Three patients had no change and disease progressed in two.
8643971	8643971-13	The overall response rate is 72%.
8643971	8643971-14	Eleven responding patients had subsequent surgery/radiotherapy or radical radiotherapy.
8643971	8643971-15	Two pathologic complete responses were observed in patients who had achieved clinical complete responses.
8643971	8643971-16	Alopecia, paresthesias, and arthralgias/myalgias have occurred frequently, but with one exception (a grade 3 myalgia) they have been grade 1 or 2.

9088814	9088814-01	Combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-induced hypotension and haemodilution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surgery.
9088814	9088814-02	The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups; those in group A (n = 10) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone, those in group B (n = 10) to haemodilution alone and those in group C (n = 10) to both controlled hypotension and haemodilution.
9088814	9088814-03	Haemodilution in groups B and C was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 mL of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution, and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22%.
9088814	9088814-04	Controlled hypotension in groups A and C was induced with PGE1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mmHg for 180 min.
9088814	9088814-05	Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR, aceto-acetate/3-hydroxybutyrate) and clinical hepatic function parameters.
9088814	9088814-06	AKBR and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups A and B.
9088814	9088814-07	In group C, AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min (-40%) and at 180 min (-49%) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min (-32%) after recovery of normotension, and SGOT, SGPT, LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation.
9088814	9088814-08	The results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of PGE1-induced hypotension and moderate haemodilution would cause impairment of hepatic function.

9660111	9660111-00	Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation.
9660111	9660111-01	Trimipramine (TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation.
9660111	9660111-02	The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown.
9660111	9660111-03	The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants.
9660111	9660111-04	TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days.
9660111	9660111-05	In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats.
9660111	9660111-06	TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects).
9660111	9660111-07	The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI.
9660111	9660111-08	It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor.

9660111	9660111-09	It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists.
9660111	9660111-10	A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.

9698967	9698967-00	An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline.
9698967	9698967-01	An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture.
9698967	9698967-02	After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up.
9698967	9698967-03	The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation.
9698967	9698967-04	Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically.
9698967	9698967-05	Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.

9855119	9855119-00	Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for at least one year.
9855119	9855119-01	BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for more than 1 year.
9855119	9855119-02	METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated.
9855119	9855119-03	Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy).
9855119	9855119-04	RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11).
9855119	9855119-05	Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively.
9855119	9855119-06	Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies).
9855119	9855119-07	The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001).
9855119	9855119-08	CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.

9869257	9869257-00	Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser PG-9.
9869257	9869257-01	The effects of PG-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated.
9869257	9869257-02	In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126.
9869257	9869257-03	In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity.
9869257	9869257-04	At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test.
9869257	9869257-05	PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
9869257	9869257-06	The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value.
9869257	9869257-07	During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9.
9869257	9869257-08	The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells.
9869257	9869257-09	Therefore, PG-9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.
